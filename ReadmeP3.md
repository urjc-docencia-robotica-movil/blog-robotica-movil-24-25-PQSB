# P3 - Obstacle Avoidance
**Date:** 13/10/2024

**Author:** Andr√©s Galea Torrecilla

## Simple Model:

### Algorithm details:
The goal is to program a local navigation algorithm based on "Virtual Force Field" (VFF) for a formula 1 car that advances through the center of the circuit avoiding any obstacle that is along the way

#### Attractive Force:
To calculate the attractive force, first I get the **attractive vector** whose coordinates are the current target coordinates relative to the F1. Once I have the **attractive vector** I obtain the **attractive force** by regulating the module of the attractive vector to a maximum value of 3, because if not, the attractive force will make the repulsive force be insignificant.

#### Repulsive Force:


#### Final/Resultant Force:

### Obtained results:
The reach the targets and avoid obstacles with a lap time of 1 minute and 10 s aprox.

## Difficulties:

While developing the algorithm I found some difficulties:
  - 
  
  -
