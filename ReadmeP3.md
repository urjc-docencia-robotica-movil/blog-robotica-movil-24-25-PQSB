**Date:** 13/10/2024

**Author:** Andr√©s Galea Torrecilla

## Simple Model:

### Algorithm details:
The goal is to program a local navigation algorithm based on "Virtual Force Field" (VFF) for a formula 1 car that advances through the center of the circuit avoiding any obstacle that is along the way

#### Attractive Force:
To calculate the attractive force, first I get the **attractive vector** 

#### Repulsive Force:


#### Final/Resultant Force:

### Obtained results:
The reach the targets and avoid obstacles with a lap time of 1 minute and 10 s aprox.

## Difficulties:

While developing the algorithm I found some difficulties:
  - 
  
  - 

  -
