## Algorithm details:
The goal is to program a localisation algorithm based on the **Monte Carlo algorithm**. The developed algorithm shall estimate the position of the robot on the map.

### Particle initialization:
To initialize the set of samples I follow the next procedure:
- Store in a **numpy** array all the free zones indexes of the map.
- Randomly choose *NPARTICLES* indexes of that array.
- For *NPARTICLES* to create, create a particle with the coordinates stored in that index of the array but in world coordinates format and add to the particle a randomly chosen orientation between 0 and 2pi.
- Assign the initial probability **1 / NPARTICLES** to every particle

This is are examples of the result (assigning 1 probability to all particles so that they can be seen):
#### 500 particles

#### 600 particles

### Particle propagation:
The propagation of particles is made using the function **HAL.getOdom()**. The idea is to use the odometry to estimate the displacement that the robot has made to apply it to all particles.
This is calculated by subtracting the odometry in **t** minus the robot odometry in **t^-1** and adding some **noise** to the result. This is due to some reasons:
- To simulate an appropiate movement since the robot movement is neither exact nor deterministic.
- To prevent particles from staying always in the same area, which may result in the particles not being able to localise properly.

### Particle weight assingment:
For particle weight assignment I follow the next procedure for each particle in the particles array:
- Get the virtual laser values of the particle.
- Calculate the difference of between the real laser and the virtual laser of that particle for **every laser beam**.
- Calculate the mean of the square of all the differences **(MSE)**.
- Calculate the final weight as **np.exp(-1 * square_mean_diff)**

### Particle resampling:
For particle resampling I follow the next procedure:
- Create an empty array with *NPARTICLES* dimensions.
- Creta a weight array that stores the weights of all particles.
- Normalize the weight array.
- Use the function **np.random.choice** with the replace option set to **TRUE** and with the weight array as reference to calculate *NPARTICLES* indexes of the array. These idexes represent the new set of particles, most of them generated near the ones who had a bigger weight in the last iteration.

**Improvement:** as to normalize I have to check that the sum of the array of probabilities is not zero, in which case I re-initialise the particles, I have also added that if the sum of probabilities is too small, I also re-initialise the particles as they will be too badly located.
