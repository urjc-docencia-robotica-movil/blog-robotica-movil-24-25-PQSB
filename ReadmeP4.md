## Algorithm details:
The goal is to program a global navigation algorithm based on **"Gradient Path Planning" (GPP)** for a taxi in a city. Once the target has been selected the taxi must reach it by the *shortest* route.

### Wave Front Algorithm:

To implement this algorithm I used the following procedure:
- There is an inicialization part where all the needed elements are defined. A *cost map**, that will store the cost of every singe expanded cell and an obstacle array, an **obstacle array** that will store the coordinates of every detected obstacle and the **frontier** (queue) that will store all cells with assigned cost pending expansion



### Obstacle expansion:

### Gradient navigation:

I used the force obtained from there to calculate linear and angular speeds the following way:
  - **linear_speed:**
  
  - **angular_speed:**

### Obtained results:
